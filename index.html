      <p class="quote">Fact: the key to any successful cooperative test is trust. And as our data clearly shows, humans, cannot be trusted. The solution? Robots! Then, fire the guys who made those robots and build better robots. Then, run those robots through a regimen of trust exercises. Creating a foundation of mutual respect. Reinforced by the simulated bonds of artificial friendship. Inspiring stuff. And finally, we put that trust to the test! Bam! Robots gave us six extra seconds of cooperation. Good job, robots.</p>
